# de-keys source code

## Description

De-keys is an open source Windows executable that is made in C using the Win32 api. The purpose is to insert special characters (accented characters in (for instance) German) into the current place where the cursor is typing. 

The project is currently in development and not in a state that it could be used for the intended purpose.
